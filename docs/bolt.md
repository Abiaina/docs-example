### My Experience with AI-Generated Code

I went to my first Vibe Coding event and learned how to use AI agents to spin up a full-stack website - just by chatting with a bot. The goal? To rapidly build and deploy a full single-page app (SPA) with complex user flows, and it was wild to see how quickly everything came together.

I met a diverse group of people working on early-stage startup ideas - from personal career growth tools and weather apps to a task manager that pulls actions from emails and projects aimed at improving women's health. The room was electric, filled with a mix of technical and non-technical folks, all excited to create.

To move fast, we needed a tool that was accessible to both technical and non-technical users. That way, we could focus on ideas instead of getting mired in the implementation details. That, I realized, is the heart of vibe coding.

We used a tool called Bolt, which converts chat-style prompts into actual code using Claude. Bolt runs on tokens (each character you type in your prompt counts as one), and while there's a free mode, long prompts add up fast. Luckily, you can streamline prompts and track token usage to manage costs more effectively. It also integrates with Supabase for your data layer and Netlify for deployment - subdomain included.
Bolt generated a single-page app using React and Express - a popular combo for building full-stack web apps quickly.
Watching the codebase come to life in real time was exciting - but also raised questions about the future of dev work.

As AI tools become more accessible, will the role of developers shift, and will non-developers take on tasks traditionally reserved for devs?
What will happen as code is designed and developed by people who aren't devs?
How do I adapt to this rapid shift?
At the same time, I was surprised by how quickly I could imagine building a full proof of concept - or even a lightweight MVP - using this workflow. While the speed was exhilarating, it also made me think about the challenges of long-term stability and the potential trade-offs that come with such quick development. It got me thinking:
How well does this hold up long-term?
What risks might arise, like technical debt, security vulnerabilities, or uncertain integrations?
Can the tool scale, be secured, and integrate with more complex systems?

As the app deployed, I wondered about real-world concerns like observability, HTTPS certs, and how the system might handle performance issues or security threats. MVPs always evolve after user feedback, but I couldn't help wondering - what would it take to turn something like this into a stable, secure, production-ready product?
Or maybe I just need a few more tokens and a bit more time vibing with AI-generated code to fully appreciate this new tool and integrate it into my dev process.

A special thanks to Bolt for providing the free account, tokens and training that allowed me to explore this cutting-edge tool. It's been an exciting opportunity to experiment with AI-generated code, and I'm thankful for the chance to push the boundaries of what's possible in this rapidly evolving space.
Thanks for reading! Have you tried vibe coding? What surprised you - or what held you back? Drop a comment - I'd love to hear your experience.
