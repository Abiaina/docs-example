title: About Me
---

I value clear systems, thoughtful defaults, and shared mental models.

I've worked on critical paths in production environments, led initiatives to improve deployment safety, and served as a subject matter expert in CI/CD and GitOps.

I care about reducing cognitive load, making system behavior visible, and supporting developersâ€”especially those working in legacy or high-stakes environments.
