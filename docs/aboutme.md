title: About Me
---

I value accessible systems, diverse and shared mental models, watercolors and learning.

I've worked on critical paths in production environments, led initiatives to improve deployment and system resiliency, and served as a subject matter expert in CI/CD and GitOps.

I care about reducing cognitive load, making system behavior visible, and supporting developersâ€”especially those working in legacy or high-stakes environments.

Sometimes, I like to paint and play music. I rely on and support community.
