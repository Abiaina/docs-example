## Overview

This site explores building resilient, observable distributed systems using Cadence and Temporal.

If you're interested in long-running workflows, system failure recovery, and developer tooling, you're in the right place.

See the [Workflows](workflows.html) page for real-world examples or [About](about.html) for more on who I am.

# Welcome to My Docs Site

# Hi, I'm [Your Name]

I'm a developer and systems thinker who focuses on building resilient software—especially when it fails.

Right now, I'm working with Cadence and Temporal to model long-running workflows that are observable, fault-tolerant, and designed to recover from the unexpected. I believe that failure isn't just a possibility—it's part of the contract.

## What I'm Working On

I'm building workflows like `HandleEatsOrder` and `DeliverOrder` to model complex business logic across distributed systems.

- **Cadence/Temporal**: Designing stateful, replayable workflows for asynchronous and event-driven systems.
- **Distributed Systems**: Experienced in chaos engineering, multi-region deployment strategies, and recovery planning.
- **Developer Experience**: I've created documentation, designed pipelines, and standardized deployment processes to support both scale and clarity. Good tooling and reproducible processes are critical for sustainable teams.

## Strong Opinions, Loosely Held

- If it only works in staging, it doesn't work.
- Resilience matters more than theoretical elegance in production.
- Observability isn't a feature—it's a foundation.
- Developers shouldn't be expected to debug a production issue without traceability and context.
- Tools should make the correct path easy and the wrong path difficult.

## About Me

I value clear systems, thoughtful defaults, and shared mental models. I've worked on critical paths in production environments, led initiatives to improve deployment safety, and served as a subject matter expert in CI/CD and GitOps.

I care about reducing cognitive load, making system behavior visible, and supporting developers—especially those working in legacy or high-stakes environments.
