# Welcome to My Project

## Overview

This site explores building resilient, observable distributed systems using Cadence and Temporal.

If you're interested in long-running workflows, system failure recovery, and developer tooling, you're in the right place.

I'm a developer and systems thinker who focuses on building resilient software—especially when it fails.

Right now, I'm working with Cadence and Temporal to model long-running workflows that are observable, fault-tolerant, and designed to recover from the unexpected. I believe that failure isn't just a possibility—it's part of the contract.

## About Me

I value clear systems, thoughtful defaults, and shared mental models. I've worked on critical paths in production environments, led initiatives to improve deployment safety, and served as a subject matter expert in CI/CD and GitOps.

I care about reducing cognitive load, making system behavior visible, and supporting developers—especially those working in legacy or high-stakes environments.

## What I'm Working On

I'm building workflows like `HandleEatsOrder` and `DeliverOrder` to model complex business logic across distributed systems.

- **Cadence/Temporal**: Designing stateful, replayable workflows for asynchronous and event-driven systems.
- **Distributed Systems**: Experienced in chaos engineering, multi-region deployment strategies, and recovery planning.
- **Developer Experience**: I've created documentation, designed pipelines, and standardized deployment processes to support both scale and clarity. Good tooling and reproducible processes are critical for sustainable teams.
