title: Cadence Feedback
---

I'm building workflows like `HandleEatsOrder` and `DeliverOrder` to model complex business logic across distributed systems.

- **Cadence/Temporal**: Designing stateful, replayable workflows for asynchronous and event-driven systems.

- **Distributed Systems**: Experienced in chaos engineering, multi-region deployment strategies, and recovery planning.
- **Developer Experience**: I've created documentation, designed pipelines, and standardized deployment processes to support both scale and clarity. Good tooling and reproducible processes are critical for sustainable teams.

I write about distributed systems, failure recovery, and developer experience. If you're working on similar challenges, let's connect!
